            <h3>Customer Experience will continue to be at the heart of the Digital Value Proposition</h3>
            <p>Traditionally, organizations have succeeded on the strength of their products and services. With little differentiation between the services offered by various organizations, Customer Experience will remain at the forefront of standing out from the crowd.</p>
            <p>Most organizations have built an understanding of the human behavior and generated customer insights through tools such as Design Thinking, JTBD, customer journey mapping etc.</p>
            <p>The key differentiation now will be how to digitally reengineer these insights using technologies, processes and tools into a digitally powered customer experience. Using the customer data gathered over the years, they now need to deliver personalized customer experiences using machine learning and artificial intelligence</p>
            <p>
            <strong>The physical and digital experiences will need to be stitched seamlessly.</strong> How do these organizations replicate the in-store personalized experience to at-home shopping experience within a mobile-app?
            </p>
            <p>We can see examples of the Customers embracing the digital experience in some of the digital banks that are operating via the digital devices and attracting hundreds of thousands of customers.</p>
            <p>Others are using the digital platforms to refine their products based on the customer feedback received via these digital channels. They are using these channels to engage with their customers, gain new product ideas and gather market information.
            </p>
            <p>It is the unified Customer Experience of the digital and physical that will make people around the world line up for their products and services.</p>

            <h3>Digitally reinventing their Operational processes</h3>
            <p>Business leaders now understand the possibility of - truly transforming the fundamentals of how they do business â€“ using the advancement in technologies.</p>
            <p>They now need to integrate the operational and strategic decision-making in new and powerful ways for eg. using the underlying analytics data, focus on dynamically adjusting prices and features of their products in response to demand, inventory levels, competition etc.</p>
            <p>They also need to take it to the next level, by building tools that help them manage supply chain processes globally so that disruption in one part of the world gets adjusted through another part of the world. This is a big learning from the current crisis.</p>
            <p>
            Automation was the first step Organizations took years ago, that allowed their teams to refocus on more strategic and innovative tasks. Over the past few years, they have carried out incremental experiments using technologies such as IoT, AI, VR, AR and many others to enhance their products and processes but now they need to embrace a more systematic approach to reinvent their businesses.

They will need to move from disconnected technology experiments to a more systematic approach to strategy and execution.

            <p><strong>The elements aimed at improving their customer experience, internal operations and building digitally powered products and services will be the key to thrive in the digitally ubiquitous, hyper-connected, digital economy.</strong></p>
